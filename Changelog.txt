* Added boilerplate.

2017-01-31
* Allow existing decon files to be skipped. (This would be a piece of a route to autodecon: i.e. just keep running this this exe as data is being acquired). Also saving of deskewed images is now parallelized with decon.

* cudaDeconv.exe will now redo initialization if it encounters a different sized .tiff stack during a batch run, instead of crashing.  Also added a --start flag that allows the program to start in the middle of a batch run.

* Made switch to enable/disable bleach correction. Bleach correction isn't valid when processing a batch of 3D tiled data (it's not a time series).

2016-10-19
* Adding option to pad raw image with mirrored values.  This should help avoid edge artifacts on all 6 sides of the volume. Padding is rounded up to nearest size for efficient FFT. Not available for rotated or deskewed images yet.

* Fixed bug with "new nx" and "DoNotAdjustResForFFT" flag. "DoNotAdjustResForFFT" will prevent resizing that occurs to make a more efficient FFT.

2016-10-05 
* Upgraded to CUDA 8.0.  Now supports compute capability 6.1 and the new Pascal GPUs (like GTX 1080). 

* You must use a display driver that supports CUDA 8.0 (i.e. get the latest NVIDIA driver)

* Fixed bug that would crash program when using cropping and processing multiple files in a batch. (thanks Rainer)

* If not enough memory is on the GPU, the program will use host PC's RAM.

* If you are processing on the GPU that drives the display, Windows will terminate cudaDecon if an iteration takes too long.  Set the windows display driver timeout to something larger (like 10 seconds instead of default 5 seconds) :
see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17186638/modifying-registry-to-increase-gpu-timeout-windows-7
Running this command from an adminstrator command prompt should set the timeout to 10 :
reg.exe ADD "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers" /v "TdrDelay" /t REG_DWORD /D "10" /f


2016-07-19 found and fixed a bug in cudaDecon (if deskewed X dimension is an odd number, then output is garbage because of incorrect FFT buffer allocation).

2016-08-19 Load full tiff file into memory and process it via a stream.  This should improve image load time over the network. Also can choose to skip over already processed files.
