Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> Everyone is
permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but
changing it is not allowed. Preamble The GNU General Public License is a free,
copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most
software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a
program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free
Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our
software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.
You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are
referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to
make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we
need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender
the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute
copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the
freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1)
assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers' and
authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this
free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified
versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed
erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny
users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them,
although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the
aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern
of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this
version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems
arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to
those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of
users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special
danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to
render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying,
distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. "This
License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. "Copyright" also
means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as
semiconductor masks. "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed
under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations. To "modify" a work means to
copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright
permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called
a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
Program. To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under
applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a
private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without
modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other
activities as well. To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that
enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user
through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An
interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the extent
that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays
an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no
warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that
licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code. The
"source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work. A
"Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard
defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified
for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers
working in that language. The "System Libraries" of an executable work include
anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major
Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is
available to the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this
context, means a major essential Component (kernel, window system, and so on) of
the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a
compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source
code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object
code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.
However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose
tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in
performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example,
Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source
files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by
intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The
Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 2. Basic
Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are
met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the
unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this
License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This
License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make
modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running
those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in
conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making
or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf,
under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any
copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions
stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3.
Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work
shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable
law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted
on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to
forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered
work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the
work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties'
legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying
Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices
stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with
section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any
warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may
offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified Source
Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of
section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: * a) The work
must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant
date. * b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement
modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices". * c) You
must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes
into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any
applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its
parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to
license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if
you have separately received it. * d) If the work has interactive user
interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program
has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other
separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the
covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit
the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source
Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: * a)
Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on
a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. * b) Convey
the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical
distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three
years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for
that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for
software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. * c) Convey individual
copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the
Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and
noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in
accord with subsection 6b. * d) Convey the object code by offering access from a
designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further
charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along
with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server,
the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a
third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding
Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these
requirements. * e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source
of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included
in conveying the object code work. A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer
product", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for
personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer
product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or
common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular
user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is
expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of
whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses,
unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute
modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version
of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the
continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an
object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a
User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the
right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient
in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is
characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be
accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified
object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in
ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a
work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be
denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication
across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code
form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or
copying. 7. Additional Terms. "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement
the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program
shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only
to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those
permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without
regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work,
you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from
any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional
permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or
can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized
by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License
with terms: * a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or * b) Requiring preservation of
specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in
the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or * c)
Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that
modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different
from the original version; or * d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of
names of licensors or authors of the material; or * e) Declining to grant rights
under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks;
or * f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual
assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All
other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions"
within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part
of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with
a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license
document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive
such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with
this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find
the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be
stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the
above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination. You may not propagate or
modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted
under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of
this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
(a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the
cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you
cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of
parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your
rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify
to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9. Acceptance
Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in
order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a
covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer
transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any
covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this
License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate
your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream
Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate
that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License. An "entity transaction" is a
transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets
of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation
of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to
the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the
previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of
the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get
it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you
may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights
granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is
infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program
or any portion of it. 11. Patents. A "contributor" is a copyright holder who
authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program
is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor
version". A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned
or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of
making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims
that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the
right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements
of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate
the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a
"patent license" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated,
not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or
covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license
to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent
against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to
copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly
available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either
(1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3)
arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend
the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered
work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country,
would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have
reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single
transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of,
a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the
covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific
copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically
extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent
license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of its
coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of
one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You
may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make
payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the
work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would
receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in
connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from
those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or
compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that
arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing
in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license
or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under
applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. If conditions are
imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict
the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of
this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if
you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying
from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both
those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the
Program. 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any
covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General
Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.
The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public
License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software
Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public
License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the
present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License "or any later
version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number
of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide
which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you
additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are
imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow
a later version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS
IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF

CeCILL-C FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

 
Notice

This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the result of
discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with the two main
principles guiding its drafting:

    * firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution of Free
    Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to users,

    * secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which it is
    conformant, both as regards the law of torts and intellectual property law,
    and the protection that it offers to both authors and holders of the
    economic rights over software.


The authors of the CeCILL (for Ce[a] C[nrs] I[nria] L[logiciel] L[ibre]) license
are:

Commissariat ˆ l'Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific, technical and
industrial research establishment, having its principal place of business at 25
rue Leblanc, immeuble Le Ponant D, 75015 Paris, France.

Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique - CNRS, a public scientific and
technological research establishment, having its principal place of business at
3 rue Michel-Ange, 75794 Paris cedex 16, France.

Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique - INRIA, a
public scientific and technological establishment, having its principal place of
business at Domaine de Voluceau, Rocquencourt, BP 105, 78153 Le Chesnay cedex,
France.

Preamble The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users
the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this license
within the framework of an open source distribution model.

The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain obligations for users
so as to preserve this status for all subsequent redistributions.

In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy, modify and
redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a limited
warranty and the software's author, the holder of the economic rights, and the
successive licensors only have limited liability.

In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or
developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to the user's
attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it complicated to use,
with the result that its use is reserved for developers and experienced
professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged
to load and test the suitability of the software as regards their requirements
in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured
and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of security. 

This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published, provided it is not
altered, and that no provisions are either added or removed herefrom.

This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the
economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.

respect of said intellectual property rights of the Holder and/or Contributors.

Article 7 - RELATED SERVICES

7.1 Under no circumstances shall the Agreement oblige the Licensor to provide
technical assistance or maintenance services for the Software. However, the
Licensor is entitled to offer this type of services. The terms and conditions of
such technical assistance, and/or such maintenance, shall be set forth in a
separate instrument. Only the Licensor offering said maintenance and/or
technical assistance services shall incur liability therefor.

7.2 Similarly, any Licensor is entitled to offer to its licensees, under its
sole responsibility, a warranty, that shall only be binding upon itself, for the

loss (i.e. loss of data, loss of profits, operating loss, loss of customers or
orders, opportunity cost, any disturbance to business activities) or any or all
legal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party, shall
constitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement to any or all
compensation from the Licensor.

Article 9 - WARRANTY

9.1 The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical state-of-the-art
when the Software was distributed did not enable all possible uses to be tested
and verified, nor for the presence of possible defects to be detected. In this
respect, the Licensee's attention has been drawn to the risks associated with
loading, using, modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software which
are reserved for experienced users. The Licensee shall be responsible for
verifying, by any or all means, the suitability of the product for its
requirements, its good working order, and for ensuring that it shall not cause
damage to either persons or properties.

9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled to grant
all the rights over the Software (including in particular the rights set forth
in Article 5).

9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied "as is" by the
Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than that provided
for in Article 9.2 and, in particular, without any warranty as to its commercial
value, its secured, safe, innovative or relevant nature. Specifically, the
Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free from any error, that it will
operate without interruption, that it will be compatible with the Licensee's own
equipment and software configuration, nor that it will meet the Licensee's
requirements.

9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the Software
does not infringe any third-party intellectual property right relating to a
patent, software or any other property right. Therefore, the Licensor disclaims
any and all liability towards the Licensee arising out of any or all proceedings
for infringement that may be instituted in respect of the use, modification and
redistribution of the Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be
instituted against the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical
and legal assistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall
be decided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the
Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any
and all liability as regards the Licensee's use of the name of the Software. No
warranty is given as regards the existence of prior rights over the name of the
Software or as regards the existence of a trademark.

Article 10 - TERMINATION

10.1 In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations hereunder, the
Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement thirty (30) days after
notice has been sent to the Licensee and has remained ineffective.

10.2 A Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be authorized to
use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any licenses that it may have
granted prior to termination of the Agreement shall remain valid subject to
their having been granted in compliance with the terms and conditions hereof.

Article 11 - MISCELLANEOUS

11.1 EXCUSABLE EVENTS Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or
failure to perform the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event of force
majeure, an act of God or an outside cause, such as defective functioning or
interruptions of the electricity or telecommunications networks, network
paralysis following a virus attack, intervention by government authorities,
natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes, fire, explosions, strikes and
labor unrest, war, etc.

11.2 Any failure by either Party, on one or more occasions, to invoke one or
more of the provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances be interpreted as
being a waiver by the interested Party of its right to invoke said provision(s)
subsequently.

11.3 The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreements, whether
written or oral, between the Parties and having the same purpose, and
constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said Parties concerning said
purpose. No supplement or modification to the terms and conditions hereof shall
be effective as between the Parties unless it is made in writing and signed by
their duly authorized representatives.

11.4 In the event that one or more of the provisions hereof were to conflict
with a current or future applicable act or legislative text, said act or
legislative text shall prevail, and the Parties shall make the necessary
amendments so as to comply with said act or legislative text. All other
provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, invalidity of a provision of the
Agreement, for any reason whatsoever, shall not cause the Agreement as a whole
to be invalid.

11.5 LANGUAGE The Agreement is drafted in both French and English and both
versions are deemed authentic.

Article 12 - NEW VERSIONS OF THE AGREEMENT

12.1 Any person is authorized to duplicate and distribute copies of this
Agreement.

12.2 So as to ensure coherence, the wording of this Agreement is protected and
may only be modified by the authors of the License, who reserve the right to
