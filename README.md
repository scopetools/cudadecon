# cudaDecon

GPU accelerated 3D image deconvolution using CUDA.  Developed in the Betzig lab at Janelia by Lin Shao and Dan Milkie.

## Notes

* Compatible GPUs are specified in this "C:\cudaDecon\CMakeLists.txt".  This also sets up all of the linking to dependent libraries.  If you end up adding other code libraries, or changing versions, etc you will want to edit this file.  Specifically where you see the lines like : "-gencode=arch=compute_75,code=sm_75"

* GPU based resources have a d_ prefix in their name such as : GPUBuffer & d_interpOTF

* transferConstants() is a function to send small data values from host to GPU device.

* The link between the function arguments of "transferConstants()" and the globals like : __constant__ unsigned const_nzotf; are found in RLgpuImpl.cu with calls like : cutilSafeCall(cudaMemcpyToSymbol(const_nzotf, &nzotf, sizeof(int)));

* This RL is based upon the built-in Matlab version : deconvlucy.m (see http://ecco2.jpl.nasa.gov/opendap/hyrax/matlab/images/images/deconvlucy.m)

* Cudadecon.exe `main()` function is in `src/linearDecon.cpp`

* If not enough memory is on the GPU, the program will use host PC's RAM.

* If you are processing on the GPU that drives the display, Windows will terminate cudaDecon if an iteration takes too long.  Set the windows display driver timeout to something larger (like 10 seconds instead of default 5 seconds) :
see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17186638/modifying-registry-to-increase-gpu-timeout-windows-7
Running this command from an adminstrator command prompt should set the timeout to 10 :
`reg.exe ADD "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers" /v "TdrDelay" /t REG_DWORD /D "10" /f`

* Better yet, use a second GPU.  The GPU you wish to use for computation only should use the TCC driver (must be a Titan or Tesla or other GPU that supports TCC).  This card should be initialized after the display GPU, so put the compute card in a slot that is > display card.  The TCC driver is selected with NVIDIAsmi.exe -L from an administrator cmd window to show the GPUs, then NVIDIAsmi.exe -dm 1 -i 0 to set TCC on GPU 0.  Then use `set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to pick the GPU the deconv code should execute on.

## Build instructions

If you simply wish to use this package, it is best to just install the precompiled binaries from conda.

To build the source, you have two options:

1. use `conda-build` to create a temporary conda environment that will build the source and link all necessary libraries in a way suitable for later installation using `conda install`
2. don't use `conda-build`, but rather create a dedicated conda environment with all of the build dependencies installed, and then use cmake directly.  This method is faster and creates an immediately useable binary (i.e. it is better for iteration if you're changing the source code), but the compiled binaries are harder to redistribute if you aren't careful about also shipping the required libraries (which are automatically installed if you use method 1).

### using `conda-build`

1. install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2. install [cudatoolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.1-download-archive-update2) (I haven't yet tried 10.2)
3. (*windows only*) install [build tools for VisualStudio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017) 2017.  For linux, all necessary build tools will be installed by conda.
4. open an `Anaconda Prompt`, and in the `base` environment, run:

    ```sh
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda install conda-build
    ```

5. `cd` into the `cudaDecon` folder
6. (*important*) set the CUDA version you want to build for (this environmental variable allows you to have multiple cuda toolkits installed, and easily change which one you build against).

    ```sh
    # windows
    set CUDA_VERSION=10.1
    
    # linux/mac
    export CUDA_VERSION=10.1
    ```

7. build the program with: `conda build conda-recipe`

It will take a little while, and then at the end, if all goes well, it will tell you where the build artifact is (for instance, on windows, mine is at `%HOMEPATH%\miniconda3\conda-bld\win-64\cudadecon-1.0.3-cu10.1.tar.bz2`).  That bz2 package is intended to be uploaded to anaconda cloud.  It doesn't include all of the dependencies (those are defined in the conda recipe and will be installed automatically).  If you want to test it locally, you can install the new bundle into a test environment:

```sh
conda create -n test -y --use-local cudadecon
conda activate test
cudaDecon.exe --help
```

### using cmake directly in a conda environment

1. install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2. install [cudatoolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.1-download-archive-update2) (I haven't yet tried 10.2)
3. (*windows only*) install [build tools for VisualStudio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017) 2017.  For linux, all necessary build tools will be installed by conda.

4. create a new conda environment with all of the dependencies installed

    ```sh
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda create -n build -y cmake boost-cpp libtiff fftw ninja
    conda activate build  
    # you will need to reactivate the "build" environment each time you close the terminal
    ```

5. create a new `build` directory inside of the top level `cudaDecon` folder

    ```sh
    mkdir build  # inside the cudaDecon folder
    cd build
    ```

6. (*windows only*) Activate your build tools:

    ```cmd
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\BuildTools\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
    ```

7. Run `cmake` and compile with `ninja` on windows or `make` on linux.

    ```sh
    # windows
    cmake ../src -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "Ninja"
    ninja

    # linux
    cmake ../src -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make -j4
    ```

    *note that you can specify the CUDA version to use by using the `-DCUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR` flag* 

The binary will be written to `cudaDecon\build\<platform>-<compiler>-release`.  If you change the source code, you can just rerun `ninja` or `make` and the binary will be updated.

## Legacy build instructions

*Note: the build pipeline for cudaDecon is under active development.  These are the legacy notes for building cudaDecon locally on a windows machine. and works with `src/CMakeLists_Dan.txt` ... though it may not find FFTW*

1. Prerequisites:
1.a. Visual Studio Community (make sure it's supported by CUDA SDK.  I'm using VS Community 2017). Run Windows Updates.
1.b. Install CMake Tools for Visual Studio.  This will give you color coded text when you make edits to CMakeLists.txt : [http://cmaketools.codeplex.com/](http://cmaketools.codeplex.com/)

Run Visual Studio
Select Tools->Visual Studio Command Prompt

At the VS command prompt, change to the Visual C++ installation directory. (The location depends on the system and the Visual Studio installation, but a file search within the Visual Studio folder (like : C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio version\) will help you find it.) 
Then configure this Command Prompt window for 64-bit command-line builds that target x64 platforms, at the command prompt, enter:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" amd64


1.b. Install CMAKE v2.6 and later

1.c. Install FFTW3

* Download the 64-bit version dlls here : [http://fftw.org/install/windows.html](http://fftw.org/install/windows.html)
* Unzip FFTW3 library into C:\fftw3 then created the x64 .lib files:

cd c:\fftw3
lib /machine:x64 /def:libfftw3-3.def
lib /machine:x64 /def:libfftw3l-3.def
lib /machine:x64 /def:libfftw3f-3.def

1.d.a Install zlib

* Download zlib source code from : [https://www.zlib.net/](https://www.zlib.net/)
* Unzip zlib1211.zip source code into c:\zlib\zlib-1.2.11 or equivalent.
* Open the solution file : C:\zlib\zlib-1.2.11\contrib\vstudio\vc14\zlibvc.sln in Visual Studio
* At the top, change the pulldown menus to "Release" and "x64".
* Build the solution. (F7 or from "Build" menu)

1.d. Install Libtiff

* I needed to change libtiff a little bit to deal with custom tiff tags.  please SVN checkout into c:\libtiff from:
https://subversion.int.janelia.org/betziglab/tool_codes/libtiff/trunk/libtiff
(Now it's git clone from dmilkie/libtiff_for_cudaDecon

* in the revisions you will see the changes that I made.  If upgrading to new libtiff version, I would recommend : 1. checkout/clone latest version.  Unzip the latest libtiff version online and overwrite c:\libtiff.  Look at the svn entry for the changes I made (i.e. rev 60), and right click each of the files in rev 60 and "compare with working copy" to merge the additions I made in the left file with the right file.  Then build.

* I think this is old.:

```sh
#  * then build:

# cd c:\libtiff
# cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DZLIB_LIBRARY:STRING=C:\zlib\zlib-1.2.11\contrib\vstudio\vc14\x64\ZlibStatRelease\zlibstat.lib -DZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR:STRING=C:\zlib\zlib-1.2.11
#  * This generates the cmake files and should identify that it found zlib.  Next run :

#  cmake --build . --config Release
#  ctest -V -C Release
```

* This should do it instead.

```cmd
cd c:\libtiff
nmake /f makefile.vc
```

* You should have new libtiff.lib file in c:\libtiff\libtiff

1.e. Install CUDA SDK (I'm using 10.1). Reboot.

1.f. Install Boost C++ Libraries.

* Download source code: https://www.boost.org/users/download/ into C:\boost folder, and build via:

```cmd
cd C:\boost\boost_1_69_0
bootstrap
.\b2 address-model=64
```

1. Generate makefiles:
2.a. Make a subdirectory under where the source code (or this README) is located; let's call it "build"
2.b. From the VS command prompt window, cd into the "build" directory just created and build like this:

```cmd
cd C:\cudaDecon\build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
```

* Make sure there's no error message. To generate makefiles from scratch, the entire content of "build" folder has to be deleted first.

3. Copy runtime .dlls :
* Copy "libfftw3f-3.dll" from C:\fftw3 into the directory with the cudaDeconv.exe
* Copy "cufft64_100.dll" and "cudart64_100.dll" into the directoy as well :

```cmd
copy c:\fftw3\libfftw3f-3.dll c:\cudaDecon\build
copy "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.1\bin\cudart64_*.dll" c:\cudaDecon\build
copy "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.1\bin\cufft64_*.dll"  c:\cudaDecon\build
```

4. Compile the libraries and executables:

```cmd
cd C:\cudaDecon\build
nmake
```

5. To generate the .sln files for Visual Studio (so that you have a nice IDE to view the source files), you can create a folder, call it "VS", then run this command within the "VS" folder:

```cmd
cd C:\cudaDecon\VS
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 Wind64"
```
