* Fixed bug with "new nx" and "DoNotAdjustResForFFT" flag.


2016-10-05 
* Upgraded to CUDA 8.0.  Now supports compute capability 6.1 and the new Pascal GPUs (like GTX 1080). 

* You must use a display driver that supports CUDA 8.0 (i.e. get the latest NVIDIA driver)

* Fixed bug that would crash program when using cropping and processing multiple files in a batch. (thanks Rainer)

* If not enough memory is on the GPU, the program will use host PC's RAM.

* If you are processing on the GPU that drives the display, Windows will terminate cudaDecon if an iteration takes too long.  Set the windows display driver timeout to something larger (like 10 seconds instead of default 5 seconds) :
see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17186638/modifying-registry-to-increase-gpu-timeout-windows-7
Running this command from an adminstrator command prompt should set the timeout to 10 :
reg.exe ADD "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers" /v "TdrDelay" /t REG_DWORD /D "10" /f

* If multiple GPUs, GPU device can be selected with --GPUdevice.  Devices can be enumerated with the --DevQuery flag, or by running the deviceQueryDrv.exe



2016-07-19 found and fixed a bug in cudaDecon (if deskewed X dimension is an odd number, then output is garbage because of incorrect FFT buffer allocation).

2016-08-19 Load full tiff file into memory and process it via a stream.  This should improve image load time over the network. Also can choose to skip over already processed files.
